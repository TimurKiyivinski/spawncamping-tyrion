fedora-vpnserver
================
My university is very strict with the internet. You can watch porn, but you may never ever access a file sharing site.
That's a shame because it gets in the way of me downloading ROMs, they block 22 despite calling themselves a "University of Technology".
Then a next issue arose, idiots wanted me to set up VPN servers for them without knowing how it works or even bothering to learn.
I made this script to assist me, any maybe you. It's specific to Fedora 22, since most deployments made are on that.
